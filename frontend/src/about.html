        Final year MEng Computing student at Imperial College London.

        <h2>Academic Interests.</h2>
        I have a strong interest in formal verification, particularly in symbolic execution and separation logic.
        Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis in this area.
        In addition to this, I'm passionate about other topics such as abstract interpretation, type theory, and functional programming.

        <h2>Experience.</h2>
        <p>
        I've previously worked at a number of companies. Most recently, I was a
        <a class="inline" href="https://blog.palantir.com/dev-versus-delta-demystifying-engineering-roles-at-palantir-ad44c2a6e87">delta</a>
        intern at Palantir, where I was working with clients across sectors. I focused on large-scale real world optimisation problems.
        </p>

        <p>
        I was also an undergraduate teaching assistant in the Department of Computing at Imperial.
        I led tutorial sessions on discrete maths, logic, reasoning about programs, and graphs / algorithms.
