        <h2>Personal Website.</h2>
        The animation on the homepage isn't a GIF! Every frame is actually rendered live, and written as text directly
        to the page. I've always found ASCII art really cool, so this was a fun little project.
        The logic to compute the Perlin noise and render it into ASCII is written in Rust, and compiled into WASM.
        I haven't worked with WASM before, and so this was a fun experiment! Getting it to run at a high enough frame-rate was an interesting challenge.

        <h2>RAFT Consensus.</h2>
        As part of a module at university, I built an implementation of the
        <a href="https://raft.github.io/" class="inline">RAFT</a> distributed consensus algorithm, in Elixir.
        Working with Elixir was fun, and trying to reason about the correctness of a distributed algorithm was interesting.

        <h2>WACC Compiler.</h2>
        As part of my compiler's course, I built a compiler for <b>WACC</b>, a while-like
        imperative language. I worked with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator" class="inline">parser-combinators</a>, which I
        really enjoyed. Programming in Scala was really fun too.
