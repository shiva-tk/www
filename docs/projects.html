        Here's a selection of some small projects that I've worked on in the past:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Personal website</b> -
                The animation on the homepage isn't a GIF! Every frame is actually rendered live, and written as text directly to the page. (Try pressing Ctrl+A and then copying).
                The logic to compute the Perlin noise and render it into ASCII is written in Rust, and compiled into WASM. I haven't worked with WASM before, and so this was a fun experiment!
                You can check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/shiva-tk/www">here</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>RAFT Consensus</b> -
                As part of a module at university, I built an implementation of the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">RAFT distributed consensus algorithm</a>, in Elixir.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>WACC Compiler</b> -
                As part of my compiler's course, I built a compiler for WACC, a while-like imperative language.
                I worked with parser-combinators, which I really enjoyed.
            </li>
        </ul>
